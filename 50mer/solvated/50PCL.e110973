NOTE 1 [file grompp.mdp, line 43]:
  grompp.mdp did not specify a value for the .mdp option "cutoff-scheme".
  Probably it was first intended for use with GROMACS before 4.6. In 4.6,
  the Verlet scheme was introduced, but the group scheme was still the
  default. The default is now the Verlet scheme, so you will observe
  different behaviour.

NOTE 2 [file grompp.mdp]:
  nstcomm < nstcalcenergy defeats the purpose of nstcalcenergy, setting

Changing nstlist from 10 to 20, rlist from 1.009 to 1.032


Will use 18 particle-particle and 6 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 24 MPI threads
Using 1 OpenMP thread per tMPI thread
Compiled SIMD instructions: SSE4.1 (Gromacs could use AVX2_256 on this machine, which is better)
starting mdrun 'PCL solvated'
100000000 steps, 100000.0 ps.

NOTE: Turning on dynamic load balancing


Writing final coordinates.

 Average load imbalance: 3.1 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 2.3 %
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.513
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 10.1 %

NOTE: 10.1 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
