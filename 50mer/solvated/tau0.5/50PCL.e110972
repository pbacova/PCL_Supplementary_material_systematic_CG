NOTE 1 [file grompp.mdp, line 43]:
  grompp.mdp did not specify a value for the .mdp option "cutoff-scheme".
  Probably it was first intended for use with GROMACS before 4.6. In 4.6,
  the Verlet scheme was introduced, but the group scheme was still the
  default. The default is now the Verlet scheme, so you will observe
  different behaviour.

NOTE 2 [file grompp.mdp]:

  nstcomm to nstcalcenergy
